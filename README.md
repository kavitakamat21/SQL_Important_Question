 # 📌SQL Practice Project – Top 50 SQL Queries :-
 
This repository contains a SQL-based mini project where I created a sample database (worker_db) and solved 50 commonly asked SQL interview queries.
It’s designed for anyone who wants to learn SQL by practice and use a real database structure for queries.
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries, scripts, and exercises that demonstrate my ability to work with relational databases. 
It covers real-world use cases such as employee management, sales analysis, and reporting.

## 📊 SQL  Project :-

### Schema for Workers, Bonus, Title.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack :-

- Database: MySQL
- Concepts Covered:
   - ✅ SELECT basics
   - ✅ String functions
   - ✅ Filtering with WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN
   - ✅ Joins (INNER, LEFT)
   - ✅ Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, MAX, AVG)
   - ✅ Grouping + HAVING
   - ✅ Subqueries
   - ✅ current date and time
   - ✅ Table cloning & set operations

## 🏗️Sample Database Schema
Worker Table
```sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Worker (
    worker_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```
Title Table
```sql

CREATE TABLE Title (
    WORKER_REF_ID INT,
    WORKER_TITLE CHAR(25),
    AFFECTED_FROM DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (WORKER_REF_ID) REFERENCES Worker(WORKER_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
Bonus Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Bonus (
    WORKER_REF_ID INT,
    BONUS_AMOUNT INT,
    BONUS_DATE DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (WORKER_REF_ID) REFERENCES Worker(WORKER_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## 📂 Project Structure

  ### ├── create_database.sql   -  Create worker_db and tables
  ### ├── insert_data.sql       - Insert sample employee, bonus, and title data
  ### ├── queries.sql           - 50 solved SQL interview questions
  ### ├── README.md             - Project documentation


## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository: 

    git clone https://github.com/kavitakamat21/sql-practice.git
     cd sql-practice

## 📚 Example Queries
1️⃣ Display FIRST_NAME with Alias WORKER_NAME
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME AS WORKER_NAME FROM Worker;
```
2️⃣ Fetch the Top 3 Maximum Salaries
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM Worker
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

3️⃣ Fetch the Top 3 Maximum Salaries
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary 
FROM Worker a 
WHERE 3 >= (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) 
    FROM Worker b 
    WHERE a.Salary <= b.Salary
)
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```

# 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By practicing these 50 SQL queries, you will master:
- How to manipulate strings in SQL (UPPER, SUBSTRING, INSTR, TRIM)
- How to filter data (WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN)
- How to aggregate and group data (GROUP BY, HAVING)
- How to find top-N salaries using subqueries and window functions
- How to work with joins across multiple tables
- How to clone and intersect tables
- How to fetch nth highest salary (a very common interview question!)



## ✅ Conclusion

This project was built to serve as a comprehensive SQL practice guide with 50 real-world queries. By working through it, you will gain:

- A solid foundation in SQL for interviews and day-to-day database work.
-  ability to analyze data efficiently using filtering, grouping, and aggregation.
- Hands-on experience with joins, subqueries, and window functions.
- The skills to solve common SQL problems like Nth highest salary, duplicate detection, top-N queries, and department-wise analysis.
